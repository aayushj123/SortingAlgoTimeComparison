# Comparison of Execution Time for Sorting Algorithms

This project automates the process of comparing execution time of sorting algorithms.

Sorting algorithms included are:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

# Features

- Generates clean output of timings in terminal
- Generates text file conatining output of timings
- Outputs a graph to Graph Output folder which shows Time Taken vs Array Sizes for each sorting algorithm

# Requirements

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.6

```
Numpy (pip install numpy)
Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
```
# How to Run
Open main.py file and change the values as required. Run using the command:
```
python main.py
```
